#space complexity of popular data structures
#O(n) - linear
#hash tables ( dictionaries ), strings, stacks, queues, arrays
#2D array O(nm) -- would this actually be O(n^)

#logorithms -- O(log(n)) or O(Nlog(n))
#the number of times you can divide a number by the logs base to get a number <= 1
#log(16) = 4 -- log without a subscript is a 2
# how many operations of 16 ( which has a base of 2 ) will we have to do before we reach the number 1
#16 / 2 = 8, 8 / 2 = 4, 4 / 2 = 2, 2 / 2 = 1 --- 4 operations

#binary search -- Log(N)
#merge sort -- MLog(N)
